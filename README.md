This is a collection of recipes I have found online and in cookbooks, which I
have transcribed into [cooklang]. I've also taken the liberty to adjust them to
my tastes. If you like one of these recipes I highly encourage you to look at the original
source, which I have included where possible.

Any errors, mistakes, or general bad taste are my fault and not that of the
original sources
